3537.000000	3554.000000	"[McClure reads the first three and a half lines of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. It was a regular habit of McClure’s to recite these lines before public performances of Ghost Tantras. The gesture “suggest[s] the origins of his poetry in early English verse,” as Michael Davidson notes (86). On the day he shot the USA Poetry episode at the San Francisco Zoo, McClure also recited Chaucer to the tree kangaroos, for whom “beast language was not right” (Kahn 340). Several months after the reading at Naropa, on November 25, 1976, McClure recited from the opening of Chaucer’s prologue on stage at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom during The Band’s famous farewell concert, immortalized in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz (1978).]"

3546.699631	3554.228486	That's Chaucer actually. It makes a nice introduction.	McClure speaking
3559.000000	3629.000000	" [McClure reads Ghost Tantra 51, page _____. As in many of his printed poems, McClure centers the Ghost Tantras down the page’s middle, an aesthetic strategy Davidson regards as beastly in its own right: “McClure compares the physical shape of his poems to biological organisms….Instead of returning to the left margin, the line asserts itself boldly as a free image, connected to the other lines like ribs to the spinal column” (86). In light of McClure’s performance and the digital lyric archive more broadly, Davidson’s observation that this meaningful shapeliness makes the line not “a score for the voice” but “a separate object among other objects” takes on curious significance. By what means can we account *both* for the line’s printed objecthood *and* the sonorous objecthood captured and audible, in this instance, on digitized tape? Even more to the point, how can we account for the historically-specific performance of McClure’s recitation—his expressive ‘re-citation’ of a printed text on June 16, 1976, the dynamic relation between page and speech, his “reading voice.” I have taken advantage of the fact that McClure’s recitation precisely reflects the printed version to respect the poem’s printed lineation in my transcriptions below. Ideally, the critical act of reading and listening simultaneously will evoke the tension at the heart of the reading voice. "	READING VOICE
