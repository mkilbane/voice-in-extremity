**The Voice in Extremity: Michael McClure and the Digital Lyric Archive** 

Matthew Kilbane

This essay and the annotations to follow listen closely to a performance by the American poet Michael McClure (1932-2020) at the Naropa Institute on June 16, 1976. In the course of demonstrating how AudiAnnotate allows for the parsing, transcription, and analysis of the recording's simultaneous voices, this project uses the occasion of McClure's reading to explain how the emergent tools and methods of the "digital lyric archive" can redress a still-tenacious "isolation tank" model of poetic performances.
